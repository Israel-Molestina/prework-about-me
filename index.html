      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p>I'm an aspiring software engineer currently residing in Philadelphia, PA.</p>

      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Originally from Ecuador, I moved to the states with my mom when I was 5 years old. I've moved around
        quite a bit, mostly within North Carolina. Finally, we settled in Chapel Hill, NC, where my mom attended
        UNC Chapel Hill. I then moved to Asheville, NC, and most recently relocated to Philadelphia, PA.
      </p>
      <h1>My favorite hobbies? </h1>
      <p> 
        <ul>
          <li>One of my newfound hobbies is woodworking. It started when my partner and I wanted to buy her dad 
            a portable ring toss game but could not find one anywhere online. We decided to just build one ourselves.
            It took a few days to do the planning, cutting, assembly and painting, but in the end, it turned out amazing!
            Since then, I've built a couple shelves in my new apartment, and refurbished an old pantry, building a new door
            for it. In the future I'm hoping to have more time free time to work on my craft, but that will have to wait
            until the spring as I don't have a workshop and it’s getting cold here in Philly.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>Another hobby of ours is exploring the city. We still have a lot to familiarize ourselves with since we moved
            here only a few months back. This usually means taking Titus on long walks and trying to get lost. Thankfully
            the city’s streets are on a grid system so it’s always easy to find our way back. 
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>I also really enjoy cooking. Mainly breakfast food. I make a damn good quiche my mom taught me, along with 
            delicious form scratch pancakes. Lately I've also been doing a lot of breakfast prep. I don’t have a lot of time
            in the mornings to cook before work, so I make a large quantity of something, usually a quiche or breakfast
            burrito mix, and eat that throughout the week. 
          </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>To be honest, I don’t have a "dream job". I believe that the 40 hour work week that this culture worships 
        was the creation of capitalists pigs, and the notion of a "dream job" is a way to trick the common people
        into buying into the idea of working until you die for the profit of a few billionaires. In reality, humans
        are so much more than work every day at your "dream job" for a few vacation days a year and good health
        care (which the government should be providing anyways). I refuse to believe my purpose is to work myself to
        death 40+ hours a week until I’m 65 and have nothing to show for it other than material objects I've bought over
        the years. But I am not naive and realize that there is not much I can do by myself, and at least for the time
        being I have to play along. So, my dream job is one that pays me well, does not overwork me and treats me 
        as a human being and not data on a spreadsheet. 
      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Currently I reside in Philadelphia, PA</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p> In the past I've had just about every other job possible from managing a farm to real estate to 
        bar manager. After the pandemic, I realized the importance of having a career that could maximize 
        my time at home with those I love. I have an amazing partner named Grace who is in the renewable 
        energy field, and the best dog in the world named Titus. I am hoping for a future where I can spend 
        more time with both of them, and my other family and friends.</p>
